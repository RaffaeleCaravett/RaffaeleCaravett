Hi there 👋

My name is Raffaele Caravetta. 
I was born ⭐ in Cosenza the 13th of October in 1994. I grew up in a near mountains 🌄 place, that has my heart. Through my experienced i fell in love with coding. I actualy know technlogies 👨🏽‍💻 like Angular, Javascript, Java, Spring and i have some projects in my personal portfolio and so, on GitHub. Do i love GitHub? Yes, i do love ❤️ GitHub and git in general. I think it is a helpful tool to track the progress and the history of your code, and a special tool for all the hr, developers and it community. I post here really often, that my motto became : 

- "Work so hard that your GitHub profile become your stackoverflow ". 💬

  I love to learn, as much as i love to travel and explore the world. 🌍
